# Introduction to Randwom Walk 
rw_decription = """
In mathematics, a random walk is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic or random process, 
that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space such as the integers.

An elementary example of a random walk is the random walk on the integer number line, 
which starts at 0 and at each step moves +1 or âˆ’1 with equal probability. 
other examples include the path traced by a molecule as it travels in a liquid or a gas (Brownian motion), 
the search path of a foraging animal, the price of a fluctuating stock and the financial status of a gambler: 
all can be approximated by random walk models, even though they may not be truly random in reality.
